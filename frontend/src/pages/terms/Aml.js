                            The financial services industry, as a whole, relies upon a four-way line of defence with regard to combatting money laundering and terrorist financing:
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The FCA aims to ‘to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK Financial System’ by requiring firms to adopt AML systems and controls, pro-active supervision of firms (including thematic reviews) and enforcement actions which have seen a number of large fines levied upon various market participants.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Firms are required to ensure that they have robust governance, effective risk procedures and adequate internal controls to manage financial crime risk. The FCA expect firms to have up to date financial crime policies and procedures which are clear and accessible to staff.

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The FCA Rules relating to anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing are contained within section 6 of the Senior Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls (‘SYSC’) section of the FCA Handbook. Regulated financial services firms are additionally subject to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (‘POCA’) (as amended), The Terrorism Act 2000 (as amended) and the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (as amended by The Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Regulations 2019 (jointly the ‘MLR’), which together establish the legal framework in the UK for anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing. Firms also need to pay attention to the guidance notes produced by the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group (‘JMLSG’), which is made up of the leading UK Trade Associations in the Financial Services Industry. These notes also include sector specific advice.


                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The FCA has also issued a publication ‘Financial Crime: A Guide for Firms’ which contains practical assistance and examples of good and bad practice for protecting the industry from financial crime.

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            This policy has been drafted in consideration of the particular risks facing our Firm and provides a grounding in the statutory framework and operating requirements and is to be read in conjunction with our AML/CTF procedures.

                            <br /><br />
                            All Staff are required to follow these procedures and sign-off processes for the identification of Clients, monitoring and reporting of suspicious activities both internally to the MLRO and  externally to the National Crime Agency (“NCA”) (if determined to be required by the MLRO, and as set out in our procedures).

                        The Serious Crime Act 2015 created a new protection from civil liability (under subsection 338(4A) of POCA) providing that: ‘where an authorised disclosure is made in good faith, no civil liability arises in respect of the disclosure on the part of the person by or on whose behalf it was made’. Therefore, as long as a person reports their suspicions in good faith and their report is not malicious/negligent, they would not be liable for civil action arising from that disclosure.

                        <br />
                        Note that under the Criminal Finances Act 2017, tax evasion is a predicate offence leading to money laundering. Corporate entities (Companies and Partnerships) who fail to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion will be committing an offence. This will apply to the facilitation of UK tax evasion and to businesses with a UK connection in respect of facilitation of non-UK tax evasion. The Company has a defence if it can prove that it had reasonable prevention measures.

                        Additionally, the Serious Crime Act 2015 created an offence (s.45) whereby any person who participates in the criminal activities of an ‘organized crime group’, commits an offence. The maximum penalty for this is 5 years’ imprisonment. A person participates if they know/reasonably suspect the criminal activities of the group or help the group carry out such activities. It is not necessary for the person to know any members of the group to participate or help them. An ‘organised crime group’ constitutes three or more people for the purpose of carrying on criminal activities.

                            The UK, along with other EU member states, is required to product a National Risk Assessment (‘NRA’) every 2 years. The NRA outlines the risks (both UK-specific and those relating to global inflows/outflows), of money laundering and terrorist financing within the regulated sector, including financial institutions and other regulated professionals, and the risks associated with cash, payments and associated arrangements. Firms must use this to assess the money laundering risks posed by their clients or operations. The UK’s first National Risk Assessment was published in October 2015 and thus subsequent reports will fall due every 2 years thereafter.

                            Under SM&CR (Senior Manager and Certification Regime), we must maintain a ‘Management Responsibilities Map’ which allocates specific responsibilities to individual Senior Management Function Managers. This Map must include responsibility for the firm’s policies and procedures for countering the risk that the firm might be used to further financial crime. Often this will be allocated to the MLRO, but should this be allocated to another person, that person would also be responsible for the supervision of the MLRO.

                            Firms such as banks, building societies and mortgage lenders are required to submit an annual financial crime report to the FCA.

                            Where a UK firm has overseas branches/subsidiaries or outsources functions to offshore locations, it must put in place a group AML/CTF policy and that its policies, controls and procedures apply to all subsidiary undertakings regardless of location.
                            Procedures must be in place regarding data protection and sharing with other members of the group for the purposes of preventing money laundering or terrorist financing. Where the overseas undertaking is based in a jurisdiction with less strict AML/CTF requirements than the UK, the firm must ensure that it applies measures equivalent to the ML regulations.
                            PQS will therefore apply the highest levels of AML & CTF standards across its business.

                            The Money Laundering Directive brought in a requirement for member states to maintain directories of beneficial owners of corporate entities incorporated in their countries. The UK has already enacted this as, since April 2016, certain UK Companies and LLPs are required to maintain a register of persons with significant control over the company. This assists firms with their KYC checks on the basis that details of individuals who are the ultimate owners/controllers of a company are publicly available, which deters (and imposes sanctions on) those who hide their interests.

                            <p className=' common-text-g'>The Joint Money Laundering Steering Group (‘JMLSG’) is an industry body that publishes guidance notes for the financial sector. These guidance notes, which are continually updated, provide best practice advice on compliance with the law, and are approved by the Treasury and thus have a semi-official status.

                                <br />

                                POCA requires a court to take account of industry guidance that has been approved by a Treasury minister when considering whether a person within the regulated sector has committed the offence of failing to report where that person knows, suspects, or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting, that another person is engaged in money laundering.
                                <br /><br />
                                Similarly, the Terrorism Act requires a court to take account of such approved industry guidance when considering whether a person within the financial sector has failed to report under that Act. MLR also provide that a court must take account of similar industry guidance in determining whether a person or institution within the regulated sector has complied with any of the requirements of the MLR.
                                <br /><br />
                                The FCA Handbook also confirms that the FCA will have regard to whether a firm has followed relevant provisions of this guidance when determining whether enforcement action is appropriate and whether to prosecute with regard to a breach of the money laundering regulations.
                                <br /><br />
                                If the firm decides not to adopt any of the measures outlined in the guidance notes, it should document the reason (divergence from JMLSG recommendations may need to be justified in the event of an investigation).
                                <br /><br />
                                The basic concept of the anti-money laundering regime centres around the philosophy: ‘know your client’ (‘KYC’), i.e. that firms should be able to produce evidence demonstrating that a client is who they say they are. The JMLSG guidance provides detailed information on how this should be achieved, by means of Customer Due Diligence (‘CDD’).

                            Firms which do not offer unduly complex products or services, or have limited international exposure, need not have an overly complex or sophisticated business risk assessment. The risk assessment needs to be documented and available to the FCA upon request. The risk assessment must take into account relevant factors outlined in the UK’s National Risk Assessment (which is published every two years).

                            The purpose of the firm-based risk assessment is that appropriate aspects of it trickle down into the individual due diligence measures taken with respect to customers and beneficial owners.

                            The firm’s risk assessment must also inform its AML/CTF procedures, controls and policies which should include (as proportionate):
                            <ul>
                                <li> 	Risk management practices, customer due diligence, reporting, record-keeping, internal controls, compliance management and employee-screening</li>
                                <li> 	(for larger firms) an independent audit function to examine and evaluate the policies and procedures.

                            </ul>
                            Firms must determine whether a prospective client can be identified using a Simplified Due Diligence (‘SDD’) procedure, or whether the client requires Enhanced Due Diligence (‘EDD’). Note that under the MLR, “client” includes beneficial owner. The ‘beneficial owner’ is defined within the regulations and is different depending on whether the client is a legal person (other than a company listed on a regulated market), trust, company, foundation or similar legal arrangement. EDD requires more rigorous due diligence for all higher risk clients, including (specifically) overseas and domestic public officials termed ‘Politically Exposed Persons’ (‘PEPs’) and in relation to remote client services (where no physical meeting with the client takes place).
                            <br />

                            The JMLSG guidance notes outline ‘customer risk factors’ at Annex 4-II of Part I (see p.57) and these are also set out in Article 33(6) of the MLR which may provide assistance when determining whether to undertake SDD or EDD. The firm must ensure that it makes a record of how it has reached the conclusion that SDD/EDD is appropriate, having made an individual risk-assessment of ML/TF in relation to the client.

                                    This ‘reliance’ regime is most often used in private equity (or structured) transactions where there is a (regulated) lead-manager to the transaction and the firm seeking to place reliance upon the lead-manager intends to participate in the transaction.

                                    <li>	An FCA authorised financial or credit institution;

                                    <li>	An auditor, accountant, lawyer etc. who is supervised by one of the bodies listed in Part 1 of Schedule 3 to the ML regulations;

                                Where such third parties are relied on, we must obtain the necessary information concerning the CDD requirements from that third party and file it for our own records. The firm must take adequate steps to ensure the third party provides, immediately on request, relevant copies of identification and verification data, as well as other relevant documentation on the identity of the customer or the beneficial owner.
                                <br /><br />
                                Where we do rely upon a third party to carry out CDD measures, we require an “introduction certificate” to be completed, BUT we must obtain their prior consent. The JMLSG guidance notes provide pro forma ‘reliance certificates’ which we can utilise. This can be found in the JMLSG guidance notes (see Part I; Annexes 5-I/1 to 5-II/2).
                                <br /><br />

                                In terms of obtaining consent, Part I, section 5.6.8 provides inter alia “The ML Regulations do not define how consent must be evidenced. Ordinarily, ‘consent’ means an acceptance of some form of proposal by one party from another – this may be written or oral, express or implied”. Notwithstanding, the Firm will only ordinarily seek to rely upon another firms’ customer due diligence where we obtain their express written consent.
                                <br /><br />
                                Notwithstanding, the relying firm still retains responsibility for any failure to comply with the Regulations.

                                        Care should be taken when relying upon electronic/digital identity checks. Firms must ensure that they understand the basis upon which a source is established and whether it is independent of the customer or whether it is under their control.

Firms may take into account data such as social media as part of their CDD,  but should use it on a corroborative basis only.
                                    </div>

                                        Staff should be cognisant that some electronic data is more reliable than others, and where any suspicions arise in relation to the integrity of such information, practical and proportionate steps should be taken accordingly to determine whether the source should be used.

                            As noted above, the FCA requires firms to establish and maintain systems and controls to enable them to identify, assess, monitor and manage their money laundering risk, and to ensure that the systems and controls are appropriate given the nature of the business.

                            Firms must carry out regular assessments of the ongoing adequacy of the systems and controls to ensure that we continue to comply with the relevant requirements. From time to time, the FCA clarify their expectations of firms as a result of ‘Thematic Reviews’ where issues or poor practices are identified across a selection of firms. In identifying money laundering risk firms should consider, a range of factors including:

Senior management as a group have ultimate responsibility for its compliance with the anti- money laundering and terrorist financing requirements.

The MLRO needs to be approved with FCA in this function. The MLRO acts as the focal point for all anti-money laundering activity within the firm. Senior management must ensure the MLRO has sufficient seniority, independence and resources to carry out the role. The FCA expects the MLRO to be based in the UK.

                                Staff must be aware of, and receive regular training about their own responsibilities, the identity and role of the MLRO, the law relating to money laundering and the potential consequences for any breach on a continuing basis.

                                The MLRO requires all Staff to undergo annual anti-money laundering training, to ensure that all Staff are aware of their individual obligations and alerted to potential AML risks relating to our particular business model.
                                <br />
                                Key elements of the Firm’s awareness and training are:
                                <li>	All relevant Staff are given  a copy of this Policy and the associated Procedures on joining the company and are required to sign an Undertaking confirming they have read and understood them;

                                <li>	All Staff receive induction and annual training on FFC, AML/KYC, ABC and Anti-Fraud.

                                <div className="py-3">
                                    The frequency of training reflects the risks posed to the firm, and the role of each individual. Training will normally be given periodically. It should be noted that the provision of regular training is a legal requirement. The firm provides AML training on an induction and on an annual basis, predominantly through an electronic training portal. Should refresher training be felt to be necessary (e.g. due to the number of shortcomings identified in the review and oversight process, then this training will be required more frequently and may be supplemented with individual and face:face training.
                                    <br />

                                    The requirements on training also apply to any agents/contractors who provide services to the Firm and whose work is relevant to our compliance with the AML regulations or is capable of contributing to the identification/mitigation of AML/CTF risks or the prevention/detection of money laundering or terrorist financing.

                                The MLRO should ensure that the Firm obtains and makes appropriate use of findings issued by the UK government or an internationally accredited international organization of which the UK is a member, such as the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”), in addition to referring to the EC list of high risk third countries. These findings are published on the JMLSG’s website when the government, a government department or FATF has examined money laundering prevention arrangements in a jurisdiction other than the UK and has found those arrangements to be materially deficient from relevant international and accepted standards. The MLRO will notify relevant Staff of any relevant findings. Note: the website of the FATF is:

                                In addition, firms must refer to the UK HM Treasury Sanctions List to ensure that potential/existing clients are not listed thereon:

                                    It is a requirement to have internal reporting arrangements for Staff to report suspicions to the MLRO, and for the MLRO to report to the NCA. The MLRO must report to the NCA if s/he knows or suspects, or has reasonable grounds to know or suspect, that a person is engaged in money laundering or that terrorist property exists. The firm must seek consent (by submitting a ‘SAR’) from the NCA prior to executing a suspicious transaction/entering into arrangements. The NCA has 7 working days to provide consent, although urgent requests are prioritised. It is an offence to proceed with the transaction before consent is confirmed.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    A firm must also freeze funds if a customer is identified as being on the ‘consolidated list’ on the HM Treasury website of suspected terrorists/sanctioned persons. An external report must be submitted to HMT’s Asset Freezing Unit by email (<Link target='_blank' to={"mailto:ofsi@hmtreasury.gov.uk"}>ofsi@hmtreasury.gov.uk</Link>)

                                    The Firm must take reasonable steps to ensure that any member of staff who handles, or is managerially responsible for handling, transactions that may involve money laundering make a report promptly to the MLRO if s/he knows or suspects; or has reasonable grounds to know or suspect; that a person is engaged in money laundering or that terrorist property exists.

                                        Staff must report any suspicious transaction as soon as possible to the MLRO. Suspicion is subjective but the courts have defined it as beyond mere speculation and based on some foundation. When someone considers a transaction to be suspicious they would not be expected to know the exact nature of the criminal offence or that those particular funds were definitely those arising from crime.
                                    </div>
                                    Guilt arises where there are proved to be facts or circumstances from which an honest and reasonable person engaged in a regulated business would have inferred knowledge or formed the suspicion that another was engaged in money laundering. Staff need to demonstrate that they took all reasonable steps in the particular circumstances to know their Client and the rationale for the transaction.
                                    <br /> Examples of suspicious transactions could include:
                                    <ul>

                                        </li>
                                        <li> 	The use of non-resident accounts, companies or structures where the customer’s needs do not appear to support this;

                                <li><strong>	Procedures for Staff
                                </strong></li>
                                This is a summary of some key aspects of our procedures, which are set out in more detail in the AML & CTF Procedures.

                                <li><strong> 	Client Identification
                                </strong></li>
                                We are required to have in place procedures for the identification of Clients, i.e., those with whom we enter into a “business relationship” or with whom we “transact”.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Our Clients are banks which are regulated or listed entities and we believe the AML risk for that category of client is low, so we will usually complete Simplified Due Diligence (‘SDD’).
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                We confirm their regulatory and/or listed status by reference to the relevant regulatory or listing authority (by obtaining their registered number and checking on the appropriate website). Where private or unlisted companies are well known, reputable organisations, with long histories in their industries and substantial public information about them, the standard evidence is likely to be sufficient to meet the firm’s obligations (but this must always be considered on a case by case basis).
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                If a regulated or listed client is not deemed low risk, perhaps because of its parent country domicile or ownership structure, we follow Enhanced Due Diligence (‘EDD’). Examples of higher risk corporate entities which may require EDD are those which may be small and/or more opaque, with little or no industry profile and those in less transparent jurisdictions, taking account of issues such as size, industry profile and industry risk.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Where an entity is known to be linked to a PEP, or to a jurisdiction assessed as carrying a higher money laundering/terrorist financing risk, this will put the entity into a higher risk category and EDD measures must  be applied.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                If we cannot obtain any of the information required, staff must report the matter immediately to the MLRO, and, subject to direction from the MLRO, withdraw the offer of our service.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                <li><strong>	Ongoing monitoring
                                </strong></li>
                                We conduct ongoing monitoring to identify any unusual activity and ensure that our CDD remains up to date. This includes ongoing satisfaction as to the ownership of material shareholders of our client banks, as set out in the EDD procedures.
                                <br />
                                <br />

                                An annual review of the KYC files is undertaken by staff to ensure that the information held remains valid.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                We therefore compare our Clients’ transactions to our expectations, which are based on the initial due diligence performed by us at the outset of the relationship. Where their transactions deviate from our expectations, staff must report our concerns immediately to the MLRO.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Transaction reporting is primarily systems driven, but as part of the monitoring activity of the MLRO, random checks are conducted as well as the standard Management Information (MI) reports generated by the software being analysed for abnormal patterns or for matches to known fraudulent accounts.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Given the confidential nature of the SAR reporting regime, the MLRO will put in place the necessary manual checks to oversee an account that is still operating as required under POCA. Given that it is important to maintain confidentiality and avoid tipping off in these circumstances no systems-based flags are initiated, nor staff advised.
                                <li><strong>	Recognition of Suspicious Activity
                                </strong></li>

                                Through our staff training and by referring queries to our MLRO, we seek to ensure we are suitably knowledgeable and skillful to enable us to recognise suspicious activity where this would have been evident to someone of our standing in a firm like ours.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                There are no hard and fast rules but Staff must to report all suspicions of money laundering to the MLRO, as this provides both the Firm and Staff with the most protections under the law. The MLRO will then take responsibility for assessment of the report and for deciding whether it has merit to further report to the NCA.
